# HEIC2JPG
## *Adaptation of [heictojpg.py](https://github.com/mpapazog/heic-to-jpg/blob/master/heictojpg.py)*

I created my own version of of heictojpg.py to suit my own needs and to work. Script requires [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/). 
To use, place into directory and it will create a new folder and convert the images.
