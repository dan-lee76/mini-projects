# SHS VSCode Installer

A python script to enable the use of VSCode @ SHS. Made entirely with python and Tkinter, whilst making use of some pre-installed modules.

## Installation

Download the raw file and run it. Best to be placed on the desktop as it will launch VSCode as well.

## What the script does

The script automatically launches VSCode with the injection to make it work properly. All current user settings should be maintained. It installs an instance of PowerShell to enable a programmer to execute their code when required instead of using idle.
